> CUCourseReviews is an iOS course review app that allows users to browse current Cornell University courses for the semester along with student reviews for each course. A student can also post their own review which consists of a short description, average amount of work per week (hours), course difficulty, and an overall course satisfaction rating. A student can also search for an existing course using the search feature. 
> This app was built using Swift UI for the frontend, the Flask web framework (Python) to develop REST API endpoints, and SQLAlchemy for database schema. This repo features the backend logic of CUCourseReviews.
> Our team consisted of two backend developers (including myself) and 2 iOS developers.
> CUCourseReviws won Best Interface for the Spring 2021 Hack Challenge (semesterly hackathon) out of 150+ students
